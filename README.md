There is a rumour about the Steve Jobs once said that he never-ever wants to see the Calculator on iPad (https://www.cultofmac.com/421893/why-the-ipad-has-never-shipped-with-a-calculator-app/), because it is too ugly and so on.
The world has changed in the last decade and the iPad became a more user friendly and more customisable device. That is why we created the iOS Calculator experience into iPad which gives us more power to work parallel with it.
